## ðŸš€ About
Launched in 2014, Vets Who Code is a non-profit dedicated to filling the nations technical skills gap with Americaâ€™s best. In order to close the digital talent gap, ease career transition for military veterans, and give military spouses skills to provide stability, we connect and train veterans remotely in web development as they move to support their families. We believe that those who serve in uniform can be the digital economyâ€™s most productive and innovative. Vets Who Code prepares veterans to enter the civilian work force with tangible skills for new careers.

Vets Who Code is a reintegration solution for veterans who believe in the principle of "To Teach a Man To Fish" to better prepare early-stage transitioning veterans who are returning to the workforce. Many veterans are un- and under-employed. Some have a deep desire to be independent business owners. Their skill sets are desperately needed to enhance local economies and drive innovation. Vets Who Code serves as a launch pad for our veterans and military spouses.
